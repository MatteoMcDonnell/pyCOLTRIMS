#pyCOLTRIMS

pyCOLTRIMS is a very much in-progress python framework(ish) for doing data processing from data taken on a COLTRIMS. 
This is amazingly specialized for the way we can output data in a .bin file from our sever.

Currently, the iPython notebook is only written to handle double coincidence, but it is easily expandable to triple coincidence.  


The only difference between the two convert files is that the pump-probe file adds another column for stage voltage. 
This means you can use this for any experiment with a stage, not just pump-probe.
